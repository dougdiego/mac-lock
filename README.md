# Mac Lock

One of my favorite features of [Alfred 2 for Mac] (https://www.alfredapp.com) is typing "Lock" to lock the screen.  When I switched back to using Spotlight, I missed this feature.  I created a Mac app that would lock the screen when launched.  You can now type "Lock" in Spotlight to lock the screen or put it in the Dock and lock the screen with one click.
